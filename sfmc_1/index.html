                 <div class="content-details">
                     <p> <b>What Is Marketing Cloud?</b> </p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Marketing Cloud helps you speak to customers with the right message at the right time. It enables you to understand each customer’s attributes, behaviors, and purchases to expertly tailor messages—strengthening customer relationships and growing your business. </li>
                         <li>Underpinned by continuous innovation, Marketing Cloud also brings together your marketing data. And with your data in one place, artificial intelligence and automation can do what they do best: create smart digital experiences. These experiences aren’t for a handful of customers. They are for every customer, no matter where they are. Whether email, mobile, advertising, the web, social media, direct mail, and more—with Marketing Cloud, you can shape every moment of the customer journey. And those moments build lasting relationships. 
                        </li>
                     </ul> 
                     <p> <b>Do You Need Marketing Cloud?</b> </p>    
                     <ul>
                        <li>Customers expect a seamless conversation with brands across every touchpoint. They want personalized interactions that also respect their preferences. And they never want to repeat themselves. Asking customers for information you should already have is like forgetting someone’s name on the first date. Not exactly the impression you want to make. Ask this: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Is your marketing data lurking in multiple systems that don’t talk to one another?
                                </li>
                                <li>Do you lack a clear picture of each customer’s preferences, purchases, and behaviors?
                                </li>
                                <li>Do your customers have an inconsistent experience with your brand depending on the channel?
                                </li>
                                <li>Are you manually personalizing messages in a way that doesn’t feel scalable?
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If you answered yes to any of these, don’t worry—they’re common marketing pitfalls. With the right tools, you can turn your customer relationships around. And remember, even the worst first dates can turn into lasting relationships. Here’s how Marketing Cloud can help.

                        </li>
                     </ul> 
                     <p> <b>How Marketing Cloud Can Build Better Relationships (and Business)</b> 
                    </p>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grow relationships and revenue. Being able to adapt is critical when it comes to customer relationships. But this can’t happen in silos. With Marketing Cloud, your teams can meet each customer where they are, increase customer lifetime value, and turn customers into raving fans.
                        </li>
                        <li>Know your customer. Having a single source of truth to fully understand and empathize with your customer has never been more important. Marketing Cloud helps you do this by bringing together known and unknown data to create a single, complete profile for each customer. And because our marketing platform is part of Salesforce Customer 360, that profile is shared across your business—powering every part of the customer journey.
                        </li>
                        <li>Humanize every moment. In order to put your customer at the center, you need to put your data to work. Marketing Cloud does just that—using AI to take personalization to the next level and create meaningful customer journeys. And that means engaging in real time, using what you know about your customers to adjust your messaging based on their behaviors.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reach peak growth. Everything Marketing Cloud offers—seamless experiences, AI-powered insights, a single customer profile—is made more impactful by unparalleled visibility into marketing performance. Unified marketing and business analytics give you the information you need to make the most of your marketing investments and increase productivity.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>From a customer’s first impression to their ongoing journey with your brand, Marketing Cloud gives you the tools to create trusted relationships. With personalized messages, unified data, and performance insights—your job just got a whole lot easier.

                 <div class="content-details">
                    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We're in the midst of a Fourth Industrial Revolution—where artificial intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are transforming the customer experience. With each of these new technologies comes a new wave of data signals. And as marketers, we need to be able to capture and make sense of all that valuable data in order to deploy intelligent marketing strategies. Disconnected data sources and departments make synchronizing all the channels that much more difficult. Luckily, this is where Marketing Cloud can help.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the age of intelligent marketing, customer engagement is not just about marketing. That’s why Marketing Cloud is part of the Salesforce Customer Success Platform, the only platform that enables companies to manage customer engagement across the complete journey: marketing, sales, commerce, and service.
                        </li>
                        <li>This module is all about helping you understand what Marketing Cloud is and how it can support both your organization and your customers. Let’s start with the basics.
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p><b>What is Marketing Cloud?
                    </b></p>  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Salesforce for Marketing is built on the world's #1 CRM platform. It enables you to know your customer, personalize with intelligence, and engage across the entire journey. It’s the only integrated customer engagement platform that enables you to deliver personalized customer engagement at scale on every channel, from email to web, mobile, social, and digital advertising. Marketing Cloud covers it all. 
                        </li>
                        <li>With Marketing Cloud, you can do things like:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Connect known and unknown profiles to gain a unified view of the customer.
                                </li>
                                <li>Leverage data and Einstein artificial intelligence to make every interaction relevant.
                                </li>
                                <li>Create two-way, real-time engagement when and where the customer wants.
                                </li>
                                <li>Measure, report, and optimize on marketing performance, impact, and customer loyalty.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                    <p class="bold">Marketing Cloud Products
                    </p>    
                    <ul>

                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>You don’t have to be a big company to use Marketing Cloud. Whether you’re a marketing team of one or 100 (or 1,000), Marketing Cloud can help you grow your company.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Marketing Cloud Rocks the Simple </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you want to target one or two particular channels, such as email or mobile, then Marketing Cloud can help you do that with Email Studio and Mobile Studio. You don’t have to use the entire suite of products all at once—use only the products that meet your needs. Think about how you want to engage your customers. Where are your customers? What’s the best way to reach them? What level of customer interaction are you looking to achieve? 

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Marketing Cloud Rocks the Complex
                    </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marketing Cloud sends over 1.5 billion emails a day. Let that sink in for a moment. That’s 1.5 billion targeted, personalized, and engaging emails every day—that’s the opposite of spam email. But do you need to reach your customers through other digital channels? We call that cross-channel marketing, and we have just the products to help you—mobile, social, advertising, and the web.

                        </li>
                        <li>However, for organizations that sell and market through large partner networks, such as franchisees, financial advisors, insurance agents, or resellers, it’s a challenge to deliver seamless customer engagement at scale. Distributed Marketing from Salesforce makes it simple for brands to deliver consistent experiences across corporate marketing and local partners networks—all on the Customer Success Platform.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Is Marketing Cloud Right for You?
                    </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To answer that question, let’s ask a different one: Do you need to reach your individual customers in a more personalized way, at scale? If the answer is yes, then Marketing Cloud is not only right for you, but we built it just for you! 

                        </li>
                        <li>When customers spend money on your products and services, they enter into a relationship with you. You want to build and cultivate that relationship to drive trust, loyalty, and ultimately increase lifetime customer value. Marketing Cloud can help you build those relationships with your current and prospective customers, users, and subscribers. 

                        </li>
                        <li>Whether you’re trying to identify new customers or cultivate existing relationships, you can use Marketing Cloud to connect to your customer through email, mobile, social, advertising, and the web—all in one place. Create a complete customer journey with automation and analytics powered by Salesforce Einstein artificial intelligence technology.

                        </li>
                        <li>Read on to find out what it means to seamlessly engage customers across the entire journey by connecting marketing, commerce, service, sales, and communities.

                        </li>

                                <li><u>Automate interactions across every touchpoint</u> Based on how a customer interacts with you, trigger specific journeys that encompass marketing, sales, service, and every touchpoint a customer might have with an organization.</li>

                        <li><u>Customer engagement</u> Design, execute, and optimize campaigns to cross-sell, upsell, incentivize, or inform existing customers on their mobile device. For instance, you can build and automate mobile text campaigns with custom templates for outbound messages, text-response, and multimedia messages (MMS). Personalize each message based on subscriber location, demographics, and individual preferences.</li>
                        <li><u>Customer acquisition</u> Design, execute, and optimize campaigns to acquire new customers via mobile app, mobile website, or messaging. This includes email opt-in campaigns and SMS info capture</li>
                        <li><u>Customer retention</u> Design, execute, and optimize campaigns to persuade customers to use a mobile app or website, reengage lapsed customers, and drive loyalty program sign-ups. For instance, you can create geo-fenced push notifications for sales and events that automatically send coupons or alerts to customers as they enter and exit targeted physical spaces. Or you can set up Bluetooth beacon devices at a specific location to deliver high-proximity geo-targeted messages.</li>
                        <li>Deliver transactional, time-sensitive messages, such as shipping notifications, appointment reminders, and fraud alerts to help acquire, engage, and retain customers.

                    <ul>
                        <li>A customer journey is like a long road trip: The scenery is diverse and there are several stops along the way. But you don’t want to drive to your destination in one day. Just the same, with customer journeys, you need to divide the trip into smaller treks. Select the part of the journey that will have the most impact as the starting point for your customer. Focus on where your business needs it the most, and go from there.

                        <li>You can build a customer’s journey in Journey Builder using the drag-and-drop tools. With these tools, you can create the flow of how and when emails, push notifications, or ads are sent to your subscribers. You can add a decision split into the journey when the customer joins your rewards program so that a coupon is automatically sent to a new rewards member. But let’s say you’ve given your customer a month to opt into the rewards program and they don’t join, a reminder email is automatically sent to reengage the customer.

                        <li>In this unit, we show you how Marketing Cloud Advertising Studio and Salesforce CDP help create custom audiences and combine data from any source to deliver more targeted marketing.

                    <ul>
                        <li>No one likes getting ads for things that aren’t relevant to them—and no marketer wants to waste money creating those sort of ads. You don’t want to advertise new acquisition offers to existing customers, right? And you probably don’t want to send a customer an offer for a product they’ve just purchased. So how can you make sure this doesn’t happen? With Advertising Studio, you can reach the right audience, with the most relevant campaign, at the right time using your Salesforce CRM data.

                        </li>

                                </li>
                                <li>Coordinate advertising with email to reach more of your audience. Increase the potential for more sales by targeting customers in email and ad platforms, such as LinkedIn and Facebook.
                                </li>
                                <li>Effectively identify and reconnect with customers who are no longer interacting with your brand—and connect with them on their preferred channel.
