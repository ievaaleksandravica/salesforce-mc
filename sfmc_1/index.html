                 <div class="content-details">
                     <p> <b>What Is Marketing Cloud?</b> </p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Marketing Cloud helps you speak to customers with the right message at the right time. It enables you to understand each customer’s attributes, behaviors, and purchases to expertly tailor messages—strengthening customer relationships and growing your business. </li>
                         <li>Underpinned by continuous innovation, Marketing Cloud also brings together your marketing data. And with your data in one place, artificial intelligence and automation can do what they do best: create smart digital experiences. These experiences aren’t for a handful of customers. They are for every customer, no matter where they are. Whether email, mobile, advertising, the web, social media, direct mail, and more—with Marketing Cloud, you can shape every moment of the customer journey. And those moments build lasting relationships. 
                        </li>
                     </ul> 
                     <p> <b>Do You Need Marketing Cloud?</b> </p>    
                     <ul>
                        <li>Customers expect a seamless conversation with brands across every touchpoint. They want personalized interactions that also respect their preferences. And they never want to repeat themselves. Asking customers for information you should already have is like forgetting someone’s name on the first date. Not exactly the impression you want to make. Ask this: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Is your marketing data lurking in multiple systems that don’t talk to one another?
                                </li>
                                <li>Do you lack a clear picture of each customer’s preferences, purchases, and behaviors?
                                </li>
                                <li>Do your customers have an inconsistent experience with your brand depending on the channel?
                                </li>
                                <li>Are you manually personalizing messages in a way that doesn’t feel scalable?
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If you answered yes to any of these, don’t worry—they’re common marketing pitfalls. With the right tools, you can turn your customer relationships around. And remember, even the worst first dates can turn into lasting relationships. Here’s how Marketing Cloud can help.

                        </li>
                     </ul> 
                     <p> <b>How Marketing Cloud Can Build Better Relationships (and Business)</b> 
                    </p>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grow relationships and revenue. Being able to adapt is critical when it comes to customer relationships. But this can’t happen in silos. With Marketing Cloud, your teams can meet each customer where they are, increase customer lifetime value, and turn customers into raving fans.
                        </li>
                        <li>Know your customer. Having a single source of truth to fully understand and empathize with your customer has never been more important. Marketing Cloud helps you do this by bringing together known and unknown data to create a single, complete profile for each customer. And because our marketing platform is part of Salesforce Customer 360, that profile is shared across your business—powering every part of the customer journey.
                        </li>
                        <li>Humanize every moment. In order to put your customer at the center, you need to put your data to work. Marketing Cloud does just that—using AI to take personalization to the next level and create meaningful customer journeys. And that means engaging in real time, using what you know about your customers to adjust your messaging based on their behaviors.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reach peak growth. Everything Marketing Cloud offers—seamless experiences, AI-powered insights, a single customer profile—is made more impactful by unparalleled visibility into marketing performance. Unified marketing and business analytics give you the information you need to make the most of your marketing investments and increase productivity.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>From a customer’s first impression to their ongoing journey with your brand, Marketing Cloud gives you the tools to create trusted relationships. With personalized messages, unified data, and performance insights—your job just got a whole lot easier.

                 <div class="content-details">
                    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We're in the midst of a Fourth Industrial Revolution—where artificial intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are transforming the customer experience. With each of these new technologies comes a new wave of data signals. And as marketers, we need to be able to capture and make sense of all that valuable data in order to deploy intelligent marketing strategies. Disconnected data sources and departments make synchronizing all the channels that much more difficult. Luckily, this is where Marketing Cloud can help.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the age of intelligent marketing, customer engagement is not just about marketing. That’s why Marketing Cloud is part of the Salesforce Customer Success Platform, the only platform that enables companies to manage customer engagement across the complete journey: marketing, sales, commerce, and service.
                        </li>
                        <li>This module is all about helping you understand what Marketing Cloud is and how it can support both your organization and your customers. Let’s start with the basics.
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p><b>What is Marketing Cloud?
                    </b></p>  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Salesforce for Marketing is built on the world's #1 CRM platform. It enables you to know your customer, personalize with intelligence, and engage across the entire journey. It’s the only integrated customer engagement platform that enables you to deliver personalized customer engagement at scale on every channel, from email to web, mobile, social, and digital advertising. Marketing Cloud covers it all. 
                        </li>
                        <li>With Marketing Cloud, you can do things like:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Connect known and unknown profiles to gain a unified view of the customer.
                                </li>
                                <li>Leverage data and Einstein artificial intelligence to make every interaction relevant.
                                </li>
                                <li>Create two-way, real-time engagement when and where the customer wants.
                                </li>
                                <li>Measure, report, and optimize on marketing performance, impact, and customer loyalty.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                    <p class="bold">Marketing Cloud Products
                    </p>    
                    <ul>

                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>You don’t have to be a big company to use Marketing Cloud. Whether you’re a marketing team of one or 100 (or 1,000), Marketing Cloud can help you grow your company.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Marketing Cloud Rocks the Simple </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you want to target one or two particular channels, such as email or mobile, then Marketing Cloud can help you do that with Email Studio and Mobile Studio. You don’t have to use the entire suite of products all at once—use only the products that meet your needs. Think about how you want to engage your customers. Where are your customers? What’s the best way to reach them? What level of customer interaction are you looking to achieve? 

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Marketing Cloud Rocks the Complex
                    </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marketing Cloud sends over 1.5 billion emails a day. Let that sink in for a moment. That’s 1.5 billion targeted, personalized, and engaging emails every day—that’s the opposite of spam email. But do you need to reach your customers through other digital channels? We call that cross-channel marketing, and we have just the products to help you—mobile, social, advertising, and the web.

                        </li>
                        <li>However, for organizations that sell and market through large partner networks, such as franchisees, financial advisors, insurance agents, or resellers, it’s a challenge to deliver seamless customer engagement at scale. Distributed Marketing from Salesforce makes it simple for brands to deliver consistent experiences across corporate marketing and local partners networks—all on the Customer Success Platform.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Is Marketing Cloud Right for You?
                    </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To answer that question, let’s ask a different one: Do you need to reach your individual customers in a more personalized way, at scale? If the answer is yes, then Marketing Cloud is not only right for you, but we built it just for you! 

                        </li>
                        <li>When customers spend money on your products and services, they enter into a relationship with you. You want to build and cultivate that relationship to drive trust, loyalty, and ultimately increase lifetime customer value. Marketing Cloud can help you build those relationships with your current and prospective customers, users, and subscribers. 

                        </li>
                        <li>Whether you’re trying to identify new customers or cultivate existing relationships, you can use Marketing Cloud to connect to your customer through email, mobile, social, advertising, and the web—all in one place. Create a complete customer journey with automation and analytics powered by Salesforce Einstein artificial intelligence technology.

                        </li>
                        <li>Read on to find out what it means to seamlessly engage customers across the entire journey by connecting marketing, commerce, service, sales, and communities.

                        </li>

                                <li><u>Automate interactions across every touchpoint</u> Based on how a customer interacts with you, trigger specific journeys that encompass marketing, sales, service, and every touchpoint a customer might have with an organization.</li>

                        <li><u>Customer engagement</u> Design, execute, and optimize campaigns to cross-sell, upsell, incentivize, or inform existing customers on their mobile device. For instance, you can build and automate mobile text campaigns with custom templates for outbound messages, text-response, and multimedia messages (MMS). Personalize each message based on subscriber location, demographics, and individual preferences.</li>
                        <li><u>Customer acquisition</u> Design, execute, and optimize campaigns to acquire new customers via mobile app, mobile website, or messaging. This includes email opt-in campaigns and SMS info capture</li>
                        <li><u>Customer retention</u> Design, execute, and optimize campaigns to persuade customers to use a mobile app or website, reengage lapsed customers, and drive loyalty program sign-ups. For instance, you can create geo-fenced push notifications for sales and events that automatically send coupons or alerts to customers as they enter and exit targeted physical spaces. Or you can set up Bluetooth beacon devices at a specific location to deliver high-proximity geo-targeted messages.</li>
                        <li>Deliver transactional, time-sensitive messages, such as shipping notifications, appointment reminders, and fraud alerts to help acquire, engage, and retain customers.

Just the same, with customer journeys, you need to divide the trip into smaller treks. Select the part of the journey that will have the most impact as the starting point for your customer. Focus on where your business needs it the most, and go from there.

But let’s say you’ve given your customer a month to opt into the rewards program and they don’t join, a reminder email is automatically sent to reengage the customer.

                        <li>No one likes getting ads for things that aren’t relevant to them—and no marketer wants to waste money creating those sort of ads.

So how can you make sure this doesn’t happen? With Advertising Studio, you can reach the right audience, with the most relevant campaign, at the right time using your Salesforce CRM data.

        <h3 >Learn How Marketing Cloud Products Work Together</h3>
        <div class="content-details">
            <p><b>Introduction </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the first four units, we discussed each of the Marketing Cloud products as individual solutions—but the real power of Marketing Cloud is how those products work together and connect to other Salesforce clouds, including Sales and Service. </li>
                <li> Now let’s talk about how a financial services brand can use Salesforce to better understand its customers, use AI to personalize experiences, and engage across every interaction in the customer lifecycle.</li>
                <li>In this scenario, we use Cumulus Bank, our fictitious financial services brand that serves millions of customers worldwide. The bank uses Marketing Cloud to attract new prospects and mature them with uniquely targeted products and services. We show you how the bank engages its latest prospect, Sandra, as she starts her search to buy a new home in London.</li>
            </ul>  
            <p><b>Attract New Customers
            </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>After spending several months in London, Sandra and her spouse decide to relocate their family there. Sandra does some online research on home mortgage options in London, and comes across Cumulus Bank. She clicks into the search result and starts checking out the website. Immediately, she notices an ad about its mobile app, which helps potential home buyers in London. Intrigued, she downloads the mobile app.
                </li>
                <li>From within the app, Sandra registers her email. While she is in the app, she sees how easy it is to get a quote on homes she likes. Amazing—and something to do on her next walk to her favorite neighborhood.
                </li>
                <li>A couple days later, Sandra receives a push notification from the app, reminding her to continue her research.

                </li>
                <li>Later that day, she decides to take a stroll around her favorite neighborhood and test out the app. She is blown away by how the app smartly adapts as she uses it—it recommends homes similar to what she is looking for.

                </li>
                <li>From those recommendations, she finds one home that looks amazing: It is in her budget, in a great location, and the perfect size for her family. She clicks to start the mortgage process. But she realizes she is getting a little ahead of herself and should discuss it with her spouse before securing financing. So she closes the app.

                </li>
            </ul>  
            <p><b>The Marketer Challenge</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As you can see, customers don’t neatly follow the journeys marketers lay out for them; they may drop off right in the middle of the buying journey. In this scenario, knowing that Sandra closed the app before securing financing, how can a Cumulus marketer find a customer like Sandra, and reengage her? First, they need to connect unknown behaviors (like Sandra on their website) with known behaviors (like the personal information Sandra entered using their app).

                </li>
                <li>To make these types of connections, the Cumulus marketer can use Salesforce CDP to view and manage all of their different customer data sources in one place. Helping Cumulus figure out who is the next-best audience they should target. Salesforce CDP ingests Cumulus data attributes and standardizes their formats so that marketers can identify and surface easy-to-understand personas and turn them into segments with just a couple clicks.

                </li>
                <li>The Cumulus marketer creates a new segment called "Working Moms, Mortgage Seekers." Then Cumulus sends it to Marketing Cloud, using its various functionalities to further personalize the customer experience. That includes site content customization, Google Analytics 360, multi-channel journeys, and suggested next-best actions to take.

                </li>
                <li>Using Journey Builder, Cumulus marketers can create a Mortgage Re-engagement Journey, and choose the audience. In this case, the audience segment is the "Working Moms, Mortgage Seekers" they just created using Salesforce CDP.

                </li>
                <li>This means that all the customers, like Sandra, who match the attributes of that persona (Working Moms, Mortgage Seekers), are brought right into this journey where Cumulus marketers can take advantage of rich Journey Builder functionality—like an Einstein Split, dynamic content, and send time optimization—so that they're only messaging customers when and where they’re most likely to engage—email, mobile, social, search, or maybe on the open web. Let’s see how this plays out for Sandra.

                </li>
            </ul>    
            <p><b>Increasing Conversion</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sandra is on her phone one day and gets an email from Cumulus with a mortgage rate offer. The timing is great as she’s now had a chance to discuss the house she found with her spouse. The email is personalized to Sandra—the marketers used Journey Builder and AI to gather data about what Sandra was looking for and created an email with a mortgage rate offer she wanted. The email is also interactive, and allows her to play around with financing options right from the email. She’s a working mom, so it’s a plus that she can finish her mortgage application without having to call and talk to somebody.

                </li>
                <li>Finally, Sandra chooses "Finish your application." It brings up the app prepopulated with information about her, which means she only needs to answer a couple of questions before submitting.

                </li>
                <li>And that's it—she submits her financing application in just a few clicks.

                </li>
                <li>A couple hours later, Sandra gets an SMS notification from Cumulus letting her know that her application has been approved, along with a special offer for an investment account with a deposit bonus. 

                </li>
                <li>Sandra is so excited about the great experience she's been having with Cumulus, that she decides to tweet about it.

                </li>
                <li>Using Social Studio, Cumulus marketers listen to all of the conversations about their brand, analyze the sentiment, and identify who the key influencers are. Cumulus marketers see that Sandra is a social media influencer and valuable customer, so they immediately “like” her tweet and respond with a personal message.

                </li>
                <li>So to recap on all the interactions you've seen Sandra have with Cumulus, she was:
                    <ul>
                        <li>On their website
                        </li>
                        <li>Saw an ad
                        </li>
                        <li>Downloaded the app
                        </li>
                        <li>Received a push notification to continue her research
                        </li>
                        <li>Tested the app
                        </li>
                        <li>Engaged with their email
                        </li>
                        <li>Submitted her financing application
                        </li>
                        <li>Was notified via SMS when approved
                        </li>
                        <li>Received a special offer
                        </li>
                        <li>Posted on Twitter
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>     
            <p><b>Growing the Relationship
            </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sandra's experience with Cumulus didn’t end there. The bank continued nurturing the relationship with more offers. When Sandra was walking past a Cumulus bank, she remembered she had received an offer for an investment account. So she dropped in.

                </li>
                <li>When Sandra sat down with the investment sales rep, they had the full context of her experience with Cumulus: her initial website search, the recommendations for homes, and her mortgage offers. She already knew Sandra as a social influencer for the brand. The rep gathered all this knowledge via Salesforce, which made it easy for her to pick up right where things left off. She got her set up with an investment account and that deposit bonus.

                </li>
                <li>On her way out, Sandra decides to withdraw some cash from the ATM before heading to the local market. This is where she gets that next-best offer. Cumulus has recognized that as a new homeowner, she might be interested in home renovation financing and they’re providing that option to her right there. She loves this and takes the offer (along with her cash). 

                </li>
                <li>A week later, Sandra receives a follow-up call from a Cumulus customer service agent, checking in about the ATM offer she received to make sure everything is going well, since there hasn't been any action taken since she accepted it.

                </li>
                <li>Thanks to having a unified customer profile view of Sandra in Salesforce, with data from Marketing Cloud and Financial Service Cloud, the agent is able to tailor the conversation and provide specific and helpful information. And due to her being a social media influencer, even invite her as a VIP to their next event as a thank you for being a loyal customer.

                </li>
                <li>That’s how we define 1-to-1 customer engagement.

                </li>
            </ul>    
            <p><b>Analyzing the impact</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>But wait. How can Cumulus marketers measure the total business impact of Sandra’s customer journey? With Marketing Cloud Intelligence.

                </li>
                <li>With Marketing Cloud Intelligence, marketers are able to connect and unify all marketing data sources, visualize AI-powered insights to optimize performance in real time, and create actionable reports to drive ROI. Using a one-click dashboard, Cumulus marketers can build a report to see exactly how their different channels and campaigns across Sandra's lifecycle are working.

                     <ul>
                         <li>When you have a powerful tool like Marketing Cloud, it’s important to have an equally powerful team to use it. So what does a marketing dream team look like? Well, there isn’t a magic formula to create a great team, but there are some commonalities. In this module, we cover the focus areas and common jobs and responsibilities that create transformational marketing teams.                        </li>
                     </ul>

                                </li>
                            </ul>
                         </li>
                         <li>Key tasks and roles fall under each of these areas. Let’s cover each area and its associated team members in more detail.  </li>
                         <li>These roles often overlap areas and can cross departments depending on the size and complexity of your organization.

                        </li>
                     </ul>  

                     <p><b>Strategy and Planning </b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Marketing Cloud is a powerful tool when paired with a solid marketing strategy. Creating strategy is often the responsibility of the marketing leader or marketing manager within an organization. However, to have a successful marketing practice, you need strategic involvement from other teams within your organization. A cross-functional strategy makes a big impact on transforming a customer’s experience with your brand. What digital experience do you want to deliver to your customers from a sales or support perspective? What metrics do you want to achieve? Developing a clear vision, business value, and system of governance helps create an effective marketing team. 

                        </li>
                        <li>To identify the specific team members that work on marketing strategy, we’re going to use the RASCI model. The RASCI model is a project management tool that stands for responsible, approves, supports, consulted, and informed (RASCI). Don’t worry if you aren’t familiar with some of the roles, we cover them in more detail later on in the module.

                        </li>
                     </ul>  

                     <p><b>Data and Analytics </b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Data is at the heart of a great digital marketing practice. From data modeling to system integrations, a marketing team needs at least one team member who loves—or at least likes—working with data. Ideally, you have team members familiar with data architecture, data compliance, system integrations, and data analysis tools. Having data is great, but knowing what to do with it is better. Let’s review what roles and responsibilities are aligned to data and analytics.  

                        </li>
                     </ul>  

                     <p><b>Creative and Content </b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>You have the strategy and the data. What’s next? The not-so-small task of creating content. What do you want your customers to see, know, and do? Your content creates the experience. Content creation team members need to understand templates, design frameworks, corporate brand standards, and accessibility guidelines. This team may also be responsible for social media posts and advertising campaigns, so they should be familiar with channel-specific content requirements. They should have a variety of content skills—from copywriting to photo editing. Here are the roles you might find on a large creative and content team.

                        </li>
                     </ul>  

                     <p><b>Campaign Operations</b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Strategy, data, and content can’t be effective if your customers don’t receive your campaigns. The deployment team is responsible for getting accurate campaigns into a customer’s inbox or mobile device. From journey creation to campaign prioritization, the campaign deployment team is responsible for quality assurance and successfully deployed campaigns. The campaign deployment team is made up of detail-oriented doers who carry out the strategy established by other teams.

                        </li>
                     </ul> 

                     <p><b>Marketing Technology </b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>The marketing technology team works across roles to transform a strategic plan with business requirements and goals into working functionality within Marketing Cloud. This team supports projects that require API development, SQL, and system integrations. They also perform day-to-day tasks like coding emails, segmenting audiences, filtering, and creating data views for reporting purposes. It’s a bonus if this team has someone who can write technical documentation about configuration projects. Let’s review technical configuration tasks and who works on them.

                        </li>
                     </ul> 

                     <p><b>Get It Done</b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Looking at these focus areas and roles, you may think that’s a lot of possible teammates! In reality, roles don’t always map to one person, and many small marketing teams share tasks and responsibilities. In the next unit, we talk about specific roles and how teams work together.

                        </li>

                         <li>What focus area includes technical configuration?

                     <ul>
                         <li>While many roles are involved in key marketing tasks, most teams consist of a lean group where one or more roles are performed by a single person with multiple skills. Since every company is unique, titles and roles are often diverse—even when tasks are the same. Here is one way you could break out the essential roles needed to create a lean marketing team. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Marketing manager (Strategy and planning) </li>
                                <li>Data architect (Data and analytics)</li>

                     <p><b>Meet the Northern Trail Outfitters Team</b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>You may have heard of Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO), our favorite—and fictional—outdoor gear and apparel retailer. We use this team as a way to illustrate concepts here on Trailhead, and their roles are closely aligned to real-life marketing teams. NTO has a pretty lean team, which means each member has multiple tasks. Let’s meet the team to review their job responsibilities and how they work together.
                            <ul>
                                <li><i>Ralph Vasquez, VP of Marketing</i> Ralph is the leader of the digital marketing team and defines the team’s strategy and vision based on NTO’s business goals. Working with Isabelle, he defines team metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). Using data, he analyzes and adjusts campaign strategy based on performance. Ralph provides strategic guidance to his team to help improve the NTO customer experience.

                                </li>
                                <li><i>Isabelle Givens, Manager of Digital Marketing</i> Isabelle is NTO’s Marketing Cloud expert and admin with a strong understanding of email and digital best practices. Isabelle manages the work of Paulo and Michele, overseeing all marketing projects and campaigns. She works with Ralph to determine a marketing strategy and team KPIs. She reviews data and analyzes metrics to provide recommendations for testing and improvements. Based on her team strategy and goals, she provides Pia with project requirements to help with solution design. Isabelle does a lot for NTO! 

                                </li>
                                <li><i>Michele Hansley, Technical Marketer </i> Michele is NTO’s email content manager. She creates and builds all of NTO’s marketing campaigns across communication channels. She built NTO’s design framework and templates and is NTO’s expert in email coding and AMPscript. She tests her emails using a variety of email clients before handing them off to Paulo. Michele also works closely with Pia and Warren to implement technical solutions in Marketing Cloud.

                                </li>
                                <li><i>Paulo Santino Mendes da Silva, Marketing Specialist </i> Paulo’s main tasks are related to campaign deployment. Paulo manages subscriber data, import, queries, and audience segmentation data for sends. He prepares all campaigns for sending, whether they are using automation or are adding the campaign into a journey in Journey Builder. Before deploying or activating any campaign he follows a deployment checklist to ensure error-free execution. Paulo also assists Isabelle with running reports and helps Michele in technical configuration when needed.

                     <ul>
                         <li>While not on the marketing team, other NTO colleagues offer critical support. Let’s meet them. 
                            <ul>
                                <li><i>Pia Larson, Enterprise Architect</i> Pia is NTO’s Salesforce expert and data architect. She works closely with Ralph and other leaders to understand and define business goals and strategy. She creates cross-cloud solutions that drive business growth, so she has a high-level understanding of all areas of NTO’s business. Pia leads the design and delivery of technical solutions and maintains a documentation repository of all NTO’s technical configuration documents.

                                </li>
                                <li><i>Warren Mehta, IT Specialist 

                                </i>Warren is in the IT department, but he supports the marketing team with API development, security updates, and data integrations. Warren helps make sure any marketing projects that require IT support are prioritized and follow change management and security protocols. He also helps Pia with technical solution documents that require IT oversight, specifically for any project that involves NTO’s data warehouse and SFTP automations.

                     <ul>
                         <li>How do these team members work together? Since they are a small team, they divide tasks and responsibilities and use Slack to collaborate on their progress. To illustrate one typical scenario, let’s imagine NTO is creating a new transactional email that uses commerce data. Here’s the sequence of events and the team members involved.
                            <ol>
                                <li>Ralph and Isabelle confirm the campaign goals.
                                </li>
                                <li>Pia gathers requirements, designs a solution, and documents the solution in a blueprint.
                                </li>
                                <li>Using the blueprint, Michele creates the transactional email and builds the transactional send journey in Journey Builder.
                                </li>
                                <li>Warren works with Michele to ensure API functionality is set up properly.
                                </li>
                                <li>Paulo reviews the email setup and performs QA tasks to ensure accuracy.
                                </li>
                                <li>Once tested and approved, Paulo activates the transactional send journey.
                                </li>
                                <li>After activation, Isabelle reviews the journey performance to ensure the campaign is performing as expected.
                                </li>

Expertise in these areas may need to shift throughout the year based on internal and external factors. And resources are often needed at specific stages of a team’s development. Here are the three main development stages and the roles to consider for each.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Implementation - Configure a new Marketing Cloud account or add new functionality.  </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>For the first two stages, check out the following chart which further highlights the skills needed during implementation and operations. In an implementation, 33% of the effort goes toward architecture, which includes developing your data model, designing solutions, and integration tasks. And in operations, 30% of the effort goes toward the development of campaigns—including audience configuration, building campaigns, and journey development.

                         <li>While the marketing team at NTO is successfully getting campaigns to its customers, they aren’t able to tackle new projects to improve processes and the customer experience. Ralph is eager to adopt a new customer journey that has been discussed for over a year now. Isabelle says it’s on the backlog, but admits that her team spends most of their time focused on campaign deployment, and everything else is secondary. Let’s review some staffing solutions for Ralph to consider.

                                </li>
                                <li>Hire short-term project help

                                </li>

                        </li>
                        <li>What hiring decision would you make? Whether your team has a marketing need, restricted budget, hiring challenges, lack of capacity, or you just need help for one project, there are several reasons companies consider outsourcing some or all work. Ultimately it depends on your current needs and marketing team goals.

                     <p><b>Keys to Success
                    </b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>No matter the composition of your team, there are recurring best practices and processes that successful marketing teams share. Here are a few tips to help your team be successful.
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Define roles and specific responsibilities.</b> Make sure each team member understands their role in all projects, and specifically the tasks they are responsible for. It may be helpful to create a team RASCI chart.</li>
                                <li><b>Minimize team members working in silos</b> All team members, regardless of channel, should work together in support of a common marketing strategy. Even if team members work on different teams, alignment and goal sharing can help minimize conflict.</li>
                                <li><b>Establish a communication plan.</b> Whether your team uses Slack, email, or shouts down the hall, establish a consistent policy for sharing when tasks are completed. Consistent internal communications between teams and internal stakeholders help form healthy team habits.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                     </ul>  

                     <p><b>Process Improvements
                    </b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Another way to create an efficient team is to clearly define the work.
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Create an intake process.</b> How can internal stakeholders request something from your team? Many intake forms ask for deadlines, content, audience requirements, and required assets. Whatever process is used, be firm and consistent with requiring that process.</li>
                                <li><b>Define configuration and deployment processes (and document them)</b> Outline the entire process and create reference and enablement materials. Once created, find a common place to store all marketing documents.</li>
                                <li><b>Determine how you track and respond to changes.</b> Establish a method for tracking the status of requests and where they are in the process. This should also include how feedback from stakeholders is captured and consolidated.</li>
                                <li><b>Organize your Marketing Cloud account.</b> Within each business unit of your Marketing Cloud account, create a consistent email folder structure. Also, it’s helpful to create a standard asset naming convention—for emails, data extensions, automations—that all production team members use.</li>
                                <li><b>Define a quality assurance (QA) testing process and use checklists.</b> Intertwine QA throughout the entire production process. It’s helpful to create checklists to ensure all requirements are accurate and have been reviewed and tested by the team. Typos and broken links be gone!
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                     </ul>  


                     <p><b>One Team, One Goal
                    </b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Overall, successful marketing teams align based on the common goal of improving customer experience. Marketing decisions should be constantly evaluated and prioritized based on how they impact that goal—and your team structure is no exception. With these roles and responsibilities in mind, we’re sure you’ll find even more ways to improve the customer experience from all aspects of your business.

In this module, we focus on the support system and resources available to help you make the most of Marketing Cloud.

                     </ul> 
                     <p><b>Begin in Marketing Cloud
                    </b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Let’s begin by reviewing the Marketing Cloud user interface and navigation bar. While you’ve probably seen this before, we want to highlight some areas and settings that you might not have discovered. Once you are logged into your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account, you see the main navigation bar and the Marketing Cloud dashboard. Not logged in? No worries—we share lots of images along the way. </li>
                         <li>Let’s start at the top left of the page. Calendar (1) links to—you guessed it—a calendar view of your past or future sends. The Campaigns (2) page is where you create campaign tags that you can assign to a variety of assets and emails to help organize and track specific communications. 

                        </li>
                        <li>Love to give feedback? Click Feedback (3) to share your ideas or suggestions for our products. Next to Feedback is your account name. Click the arrow icon to see a dropdown of the business units you have access to (it may just be one). From this dropdown, in addition to the name, you will see a unique number associated with the business unit (we call this the MID). This is helpful information to have if you are working with support and have to reference which account you need help with.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the header, just below your username, you can select which apps you see by toggling between the radio buttons for My Apps and All Apps (4). My Apps only shows apps that are available in your account and All Apps shows all potential Marketing Cloud products. (We recommend you switch this to My Apps for less clutter.) </li>
                        <li>Now let’s navigate to the dropdown menu under your username. Here are the options. 
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Setup</b> Setup is the first menu option and is used by admins for account configuration. You can find general metrics, an account checklist, and links to release notes on this page. If you aren’t an admin, you won’t see this as an option in your dropdown navigation.

                                </li>
                                <li><b>Cloud Preferences</b> Next, Cloud Preferences is where you can review your personal user settings—like confirming your time zone—and your login preference. When you log into Marketing Cloud, by default you see the Marketing Cloud Dashboard page first. However, you can update your account to login to the page you visit most often. For example, if you spend all your time in Journey Builder, you can save yourself a few clicks by updating your preferences to log in directly to the Journey Builder dashboard. </li>
                                <li><b>Show Tips</b> This menu option is pretty straightforward, you can select to either show or hide in-app tips. We suggest you keep them visible for now, as they are helpful for new users.

                                </li>
                                <li><b>Salesforce Help & Training</b> The Salesforce Help & Training menu option links you directly to the Salesforce Help page where you can view Salesforce Docs, Developer Docs, learn on Trailhead, join a community group, and more. 

                                </li>
                                <li><b>Trust</b> The Trust menu option takes you to the Salesforce Trust homepage to find information on service availability and performance, along with information about our security and compliance procedures. This is a good page to bookmark in case you experience issues in your account and want to check to see if there is a known system issue.

                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                     </ul>  
                     <p><b>Navigate Resources </b></p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>There’s a ton of good stuff waiting for you on our Help and community pages. Let’s take a look at an overview of resources available on the Salesforce Help home page. 

                        </li>
                        <li>You are already familiar with Trailhead and the Trust site, so let’s cover the other areas.
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Salesforce Docs</b> Locate the help documentation for a product or topic. (We cover this in more detail in the next unit.)

                                </li>
                                <li><b>Developer Docs</b> Find the developer documentation for a product or topic.

                                </li>
                                <li><b>Trailblazer Community</b> This is your feed of topics you follow in the Trailblazer community. Follow specific people, topics, and post your questions or helpful resources. 

                                </li>
                                <li><b>Events</b> Learn about upcoming Salesforce community events. This calendar is your go-to for in-person and virtual events led by Salesforce experts. 

                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Don’t worry, we cover each of these areas in more detail throughout this module. In the next unit, we explore Salesforce Help.

                       <ul>
                           <li>Now that you have a general idea of available resources, let's shift our focus to documentation and other resources available for Marketing Cloud users.

                        </li>
                        <li>Salesforce Help offers a central location for documentation and training about all of our products. Use Salesforce Help to locate topics, how-to instructions, release information, implementation guides, and general best practice content.

                        </li>
                        <li>With so many products in the Salesforce ecosystem, we want to focus on how you can find Marketing Cloud content specifically. Let’s check it out together. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Start at the Salesforce Help home page and choose Marketing (1).</li>
                                <li>In the Marketing Cloud docs section, topics are grouped by product areas, such as Marketing Cloud Data Management and Analytics.

                                </li>
                                <li>Each product area breaks the topic down into small, specific content sections to help you easily find the information you need. You can also find related resources and recommended learning suggestions based on the topic you select. For example, under Marketing Cloud Data Management and Analytics, find topics like Google Analytics and Marketing Cloud Einstein.

                                </li>
                            </ul>

                       <p><b>Search Documentation</b></p>
                       <ul>
                        <li>If you aren’t sure of the topic, you can use the magnifying glass icon in the navigation bar to do a topic search. 

                        </li>
                        <li>Pro tip: search and then use the left-hand navigation to filter and narrow down your search. Let’s say you decide to type “email” in the search bar. Results include all content found in documentation with the word email. That’s where the filters come in handy. If you select the Topic Marketing Cloud after you search (1), your results immediately narrow. You can also narrow results by Content Type (2) and Experience (3).

                        </li>
                        <li>Bonus: Help search results also include Trailhead module content.
