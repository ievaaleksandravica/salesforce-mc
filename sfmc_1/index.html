                 <div class="content-details">
                     <p> <b>What Is Marketing Cloud?</b> </p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Marketing Cloud helps you speak to customers with the right message at the right time. It enables you to understand each customer’s attributes, behaviors, and purchases to expertly tailor messages—strengthening customer relationships and growing your business. </li>
                         <li>Underpinned by continuous innovation, Marketing Cloud also brings together your marketing data. And with your data in one place, artificial intelligence and automation can do what they do best: create smart digital experiences. These experiences aren’t for a handful of customers. They are for every customer, no matter where they are. Whether email, mobile, advertising, the web, social media, direct mail, and more—with Marketing Cloud, you can shape every moment of the customer journey. And those moments build lasting relationships. 
                        </li>
                     </ul> 
                     <p> <b>Do You Need Marketing Cloud?</b> </p>    
                     <ul>
                        <li>Customers expect a seamless conversation with brands across every touchpoint. They want personalized interactions that also respect their preferences. And they never want to repeat themselves. Asking customers for information you should already have is like forgetting someone’s name on the first date. Not exactly the impression you want to make. Ask this: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Is your marketing data lurking in multiple systems that don’t talk to one another?
                                </li>
                                <li>Do you lack a clear picture of each customer’s preferences, purchases, and behaviors?
                                </li>
                                <li>Do your customers have an inconsistent experience with your brand depending on the channel?
                                </li>
                                <li>Are you manually personalizing messages in a way that doesn’t feel scalable?
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If you answered yes to any of these, don’t worry—they’re common marketing pitfalls. With the right tools, you can turn your customer relationships around. And remember, even the worst first dates can turn into lasting relationships. Here’s how Marketing Cloud can help.

                        </li>
                     </ul> 
                     <p> <b>How Marketing Cloud Can Build Better Relationships (and Business)</b> 
                    </p>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Grow relationships and revenue. Being able to adapt is critical when it comes to customer relationships. But this can’t happen in silos. With Marketing Cloud, your teams can meet each customer where they are, increase customer lifetime value, and turn customers into raving fans.
                        </li>
                        <li>Know your customer. Having a single source of truth to fully understand and empathize with your customer has never been more important. Marketing Cloud helps you do this by bringing together known and unknown data to create a single, complete profile for each customer. And because our marketing platform is part of Salesforce Customer 360, that profile is shared across your business—powering every part of the customer journey.
                        </li>
                        <li>Humanize every moment. In order to put your customer at the center, you need to put your data to work. Marketing Cloud does just that—using AI to take personalization to the next level and create meaningful customer journeys. And that means engaging in real time, using what you know about your customers to adjust your messaging based on their behaviors.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reach peak growth. Everything Marketing Cloud offers—seamless experiences, AI-powered insights, a single customer profile—is made more impactful by unparalleled visibility into marketing performance. Unified marketing and business analytics give you the information you need to make the most of your marketing investments and increase productivity.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>From a customer’s first impression to their ongoing journey with your brand, Marketing Cloud gives you the tools to create trusted relationships. With personalized messages, unified data, and performance insights—your job just got a whole lot easier.

                 <div class="content-details">
                    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We're in the midst of a Fourth Industrial Revolution—where artificial intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are transforming the customer experience. With each of these new technologies comes a new wave of data signals. And as marketers, we need to be able to capture and make sense of all that valuable data in order to deploy intelligent marketing strategies. Disconnected data sources and departments make synchronizing all the channels that much more difficult. Luckily, this is where Marketing Cloud can help.
                        </li>
                        <li>In the age of intelligent marketing, customer engagement is not just about marketing. That’s why Marketing Cloud is part of the Salesforce Customer Success Platform, the only platform that enables companies to manage customer engagement across the complete journey: marketing, sales, commerce, and service.
                        </li>
                        <li>This module is all about helping you understand what Marketing Cloud is and how it can support both your organization and your customers. Let’s start with the basics.
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p><b>What is Marketing Cloud?
                    </b></p>  
                    <ul>
                        <li>Salesforce for Marketing is built on the world's #1 CRM platform. It enables you to know your customer, personalize with intelligence, and engage across the entire journey. It’s the only integrated customer engagement platform that enables you to deliver personalized customer engagement at scale on every channel, from email to web, mobile, social, and digital advertising. Marketing Cloud covers it all. 
                        </li>
                        <li>With Marketing Cloud, you can do things like:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Connect known and unknown profiles to gain a unified view of the customer.
                                </li>
                                <li>Leverage data and Einstein artificial intelligence to make every interaction relevant.
                                </li>
                                <li>Create two-way, real-time engagement when and where the customer wants.
                                </li>
                                <li>Measure, report, and optimize on marketing performance, impact, and customer loyalty.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                    <p class="bold">Marketing Cloud Products
                    </p>    
                    <ul>

                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>You don’t have to be a big company to use Marketing Cloud. Whether you’re a marketing team of one or 100 (or 1,000), Marketing Cloud can help you grow your company.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Marketing Cloud Rocks the Simple </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you want to target one or two particular channels, such as email or mobile, then Marketing Cloud can help you do that with Email Studio and Mobile Studio. You don’t have to use the entire suite of products all at once—use only the products that meet your needs. Think about how you want to engage your customers. Where are your customers? What’s the best way to reach them? What level of customer interaction are you looking to achieve? 

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Marketing Cloud Rocks the Complex
                    </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marketing Cloud sends over 1.5 billion emails a day. Let that sink in for a moment. That’s 1.5 billion targeted, personalized, and engaging emails every day—that’s the opposite of spam email. But do you need to reach your customers through other digital channels? We call that cross-channel marketing, and we have just the products to help you—mobile, social, advertising, and the web.

                        </li>
                        <li>However, for organizations that sell and market through large partner networks, such as franchisees, financial advisors, insurance agents, or resellers, it’s a challenge to deliver seamless customer engagement at scale. Distributed Marketing from Salesforce makes it simple for brands to deliver consistent experiences across corporate marketing and local partners networks—all on the Customer Success Platform.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Is Marketing Cloud Right for You?
                    </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To answer that question, let’s ask a different one: Do you need to reach your individual customers in a more personalized way, at scale? If the answer is yes, then Marketing Cloud is not only right for you, but we built it just for you! 

                        </li>
                        <li>When customers spend money on your products and services, they enter into a relationship with you. You want to build and cultivate that relationship to drive trust, loyalty, and ultimately increase lifetime customer value. Marketing Cloud can help you build those relationships with your current and prospective customers, users, and subscribers. 

                        </li>
                        <li>Whether you’re trying to identify new customers or cultivate existing relationships, you can use Marketing Cloud to connect to your customer through email, mobile, social, advertising, and the web—all in one place. Create a complete customer journey with automation and analytics powered by Salesforce Einstein artificial intelligence technology.

                        </li>
                        <li>Read on to find out what it means to seamlessly engage customers across the entire journey by connecting marketing, commerce, service, sales, and communities.

                        </li>

                                <li><u>Automate interactions across every touchpoint</u> Based on how a customer interacts with you, trigger specific journeys that encompass marketing, sales, service, and every touchpoint a customer might have with an organization.</li>

                        <li><u>Customer engagement</u> Design, execute, and optimize campaigns to cross-sell, upsell, incentivize, or inform existing customers on their mobile device. For instance, you can build and automate mobile text campaigns with custom templates for outbound messages, text-response, and multimedia messages (MMS). Personalize each message based on subscriber location, demographics, and individual preferences.</li>
                        <li><u>Customer acquisition</u> Design, execute, and optimize campaigns to acquire new customers via mobile app, mobile website, or messaging. This includes email opt-in campaigns and SMS info capture</li>
                        <li><u>Customer retention</u> Design, execute, and optimize campaigns to persuade customers to use a mobile app or website, reengage lapsed customers, and drive loyalty program sign-ups. For instance, you can create geo-fenced push notifications for sales and events that automatically send coupons or alerts to customers as they enter and exit targeted physical spaces. Or you can set up Bluetooth beacon devices at a specific location to deliver high-proximity geo-targeted messages.</li>
                        <li>Deliver transactional, time-sensitive messages, such as shipping notifications, appointment reminders, and fraud alerts to help acquire, engage, and retain customers.

Just the same, with customer journeys, you need to divide the trip into smaller treks. Select the part of the journey that will have the most impact as the starting point for your customer. Focus on where your business needs it the most, and go from there.

But let’s say you’ve given your customer a month to opt into the rewards program and they don’t join, a reminder email is automatically sent to reengage the customer.

                        <li>No one likes getting ads for things that aren’t relevant to them—and no marketer wants to waste money creating those sort of ads.

So how can you make sure this doesn’t happen? With Advertising Studio, you can reach the right audience, with the most relevant campaign, at the right time using your Salesforce CRM data.

        <h3 >Learn How Marketing Cloud Products Work Together</h3>
        <div class="content-details">
            <p><b>Introduction </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the first four units, we discussed each of the Marketing Cloud products as individual solutions—but the real power of Marketing Cloud is how those products work together and connect to other Salesforce clouds, including Sales and Service. </li>
                <li> Now let’s talk about how a financial services brand can use Salesforce to better understand its customers, use AI to personalize experiences, and engage across every interaction in the customer lifecycle.</li>
                <li>In this scenario, we use Cumulus Bank, our fictitious financial services brand that serves millions of customers worldwide. The bank uses Marketing Cloud to attract new prospects and mature them with uniquely targeted products and services. We show you how the bank engages its latest prospect, Sandra, as she starts her search to buy a new home in London.</li>
            </ul>  
            <p><b>Attract New Customers
            </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>After spending several months in London, Sandra and her spouse decide to relocate their family there. Sandra does some online research on home mortgage options in London, and comes across Cumulus Bank. She clicks into the search result and starts checking out the website. Immediately, she notices an ad about its mobile app, which helps potential home buyers in London. Intrigued, she downloads the mobile app.
                </li>
                <li>From within the app, Sandra registers her email. While she is in the app, she sees how easy it is to get a quote on homes she likes. Amazing—and something to do on her next walk to her favorite neighborhood.
                </li>
                <li>A couple days later, Sandra receives a push notification from the app, reminding her to continue her research.

                </li>
                <li>Later that day, she decides to take a stroll around her favorite neighborhood and test out the app. She is blown away by how the app smartly adapts as she uses it—it recommends homes similar to what she is looking for.

                </li>
                <li>From those recommendations, she finds one home that looks amazing: It is in her budget, in a great location, and the perfect size for her family. She clicks to start the mortgage process. But she realizes she is getting a little ahead of herself and should discuss it with her spouse before securing financing. So she closes the app.

                </li>
            </ul>  
            <p><b>The Marketer Challenge</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As you can see, customers don’t neatly follow the journeys marketers lay out for them; they may drop off right in the middle of the buying journey. In this scenario, knowing that Sandra closed the app before securing financing, how can a Cumulus marketer find a customer like Sandra, and reengage her? First, they need to connect unknown behaviors (like Sandra on their website) with known behaviors (like the personal information Sandra entered using their app).

                </li>
                <li>To make these types of connections, the Cumulus marketer can use Salesforce CDP to view and manage all of their different customer data sources in one place. Helping Cumulus figure out who is the next-best audience they should target. Salesforce CDP ingests Cumulus data attributes and standardizes their formats so that marketers can identify and surface easy-to-understand personas and turn them into segments with just a couple clicks.

                </li>
                <li>The Cumulus marketer creates a new segment called "Working Moms, Mortgage Seekers." Then Cumulus sends it to Marketing Cloud, using its various functionalities to further personalize the customer experience. That includes site content customization, Google Analytics 360, multi-channel journeys, and suggested next-best actions to take.

                </li>
                <li>Using Journey Builder, Cumulus marketers can create a Mortgage Re-engagement Journey, and choose the audience. In this case, the audience segment is the "Working Moms, Mortgage Seekers" they just created using Salesforce CDP.

                </li>
                <li>This means that all the customers, like Sandra, who match the attributes of that persona (Working Moms, Mortgage Seekers), are brought right into this journey where Cumulus marketers can take advantage of rich Journey Builder functionality—like an Einstein Split, dynamic content, and send time optimization—so that they're only messaging customers when and where they’re most likely to engage—email, mobile, social, search, or maybe on the open web. Let’s see how this plays out for Sandra.

                </li>
            </ul>    
            <p><b>Increasing Conversion</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sandra is on her phone one day and gets an email from Cumulus with a mortgage rate offer. The timing is great as she’s now had a chance to discuss the house she found with her spouse. The email is personalized to Sandra—the marketers used Journey Builder and AI to gather data about what Sandra was looking for and created an email with a mortgage rate offer she wanted. The email is also interactive, and allows her to play around with financing options right from the email. She’s a working mom, so it’s a plus that she can finish her mortgage application without having to call and talk to somebody.

                </li>
                <li>Finally, Sandra chooses "Finish your application." It brings up the app prepopulated with information about her, which means she only needs to answer a couple of questions before submitting.

                </li>
                <li>And that's it—she submits her financing application in just a few clicks.

                </li>
                <li>A couple hours later, Sandra gets an SMS notification from Cumulus letting her know that her application has been approved, along with a special offer for an investment account with a deposit bonus. 

                </li>
                <li>Sandra is so excited about the great experience she's been having with Cumulus, that she decides to tweet about it.

                </li>
                <li>Using Social Studio, Cumulus marketers listen to all of the conversations about their brand, analyze the sentiment, and identify who the key influencers are. Cumulus marketers see that Sandra is a social media influencer and valuable customer, so they immediately “like” her tweet and respond with a personal message.

                </li>
                <li>So to recap on all the interactions you've seen Sandra have with Cumulus, she was:
                    <ul>
                        <li>On their website
                        </li>
                        <li>Saw an ad
                        </li>
                        <li>Downloaded the app
                        </li>
                        <li>Received a push notification to continue her research
                        </li>
                        <li>Tested the app
                        </li>
                        <li>Engaged with their email
                        </li>
                        <li>Submitted her financing application
                        </li>
                        <li>Was notified via SMS when approved
                        </li>
                        <li>Received a special offer
                        </li>
                        <li>Posted on Twitter
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>     
            <p><b>Growing the Relationship
            </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sandra's experience with Cumulus didn’t end there. The bank continued nurturing the relationship with more offers. When Sandra was walking past a Cumulus bank, she remembered she had received an offer for an investment account. So she dropped in.

                </li>
                <li>When Sandra sat down with the investment sales rep, they had the full context of her experience with Cumulus: her initial website search, the recommendations for homes, and her mortgage offers. She already knew Sandra as a social influencer for the brand. The rep gathered all this knowledge via Salesforce, which made it easy for her to pick up right where things left off. She got her set up with an investment account and that deposit bonus.

                </li>
                <li>On her way out, Sandra decides to withdraw some cash from the ATM before heading to the local market. This is where she gets that next-best offer. Cumulus has recognized that as a new homeowner, she might be interested in home renovation financing and they’re providing that option to her right there. She loves this and takes the offer (along with her cash). 

                </li>
                <li>A week later, Sandra receives a follow-up call from a Cumulus customer service agent, checking in about the ATM offer she received to make sure everything is going well, since there hasn't been any action taken since she accepted it.

                </li>
                <li>Thanks to having a unified customer profile view of Sandra in Salesforce, with data from Marketing Cloud and Financial Service Cloud, the agent is able to tailor the conversation and provide specific and helpful information. And due to her being a social media influencer, even invite her as a VIP to their next event as a thank you for being a loyal customer.

                </li>
                <li>That’s how we define 1-to-1 customer engagement.

                </li>
            </ul>    
            <p><b>Analyzing the impact</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>But wait. How can Cumulus marketers measure the total business impact of Sandra’s customer journey? With Marketing Cloud Intelligence.

                </li>
                <li>With Marketing Cloud Intelligence, marketers are able to connect and unify all marketing data sources, visualize AI-powered insights to optimize performance in real time, and create actionable reports to drive ROI. Using a one-click dashboard, Cumulus marketers can build a report to see exactly how their different channels and campaigns across Sandra's lifecycle are working.
